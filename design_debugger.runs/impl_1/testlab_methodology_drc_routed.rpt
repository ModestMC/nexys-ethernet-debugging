2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks eth_rx_clk_pin and ethernet_n_6 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks eth_rx_clk_pin] -to [get_clocks ethernet_n_6]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks eth_rx_clk_pin and ethernet_n_6 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks eth_rx_clk_pin] -to [get_clocks ethernet_n_6]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on eth_rxctl relative to clock(s) eth_rx_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on eth_rxd[0] relative to clock(s) eth_rx_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay
